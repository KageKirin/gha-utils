# gha-utils

This repo contains a collection of miscellanous but useful GitHub Actions
that I put into a separate repo for re-use across other projects.

## Caveat

The GitHub Actions are simple enough to be used by other projects that I'm not involved with.
However, I can't assure that things change in a non-breaking way. Use at your own risk.

## Sidenote

The GitHub Actions here were converted from CircleCI workflows via `gh actions-importer`,
and then manually adapted to their current shape.

## Contributions / PRs

Contributions are welcome. Please create an issue first to discuss it.
